# Spotify Analysis

There's some difference between the music my wife and I listen to, so I compared two of our Spotify playlists for fun one Sunday. Spotify's API lets you get auditory features for each song such as 'energy', 'tempo', and 'valence'.

Sure enough, there were differences.

## Requirements

The usual PyData stack (scipy, numpy, pandas, xgboost) and spotipy.
